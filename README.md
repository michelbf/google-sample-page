# google-sample-page
This is my first ever attempt at html/css coding, so I am trying this project as suggested by The Odin Project.
The objective is just to replicate Google's homepage layout. 
No functionalities - just the looks.

If you click on any of the main page's buttons, you'll be taken to a pseudo-"search results page".
Again: no funcionalities: just the styling, positioning etc.

I am also using a CSS reset sheet from http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
